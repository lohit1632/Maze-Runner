# Maze Runner

This project is a Maze Runner application developed using the `pyMaze` module. It includes implementations of various pathfinding algorithms such as BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), and A* to find the path between the source and destination cells in a maze.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Automatically generate mazes using the `pyMaze` module.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Implementations of BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms to solve the maze.
- **Visualization**: Visual representation of the maze and the path found by the algorithms.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maze-runner.git
   cd maze-runner
   ```

## Algorithms

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**: Explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- **DFS (Depth-First Search)**: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- **A***: Utilizes heuristics to efficiently find the shortest path from the source to the destination.
